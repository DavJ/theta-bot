## [2025-10-25] Atlas Evaluation Document (PR #8)  

- Added `theta_bot_averaging/paper/atlas_evaluation.tex`, a LaTeX document that evaluates the correctness and physical consistency of the Jacobi theta functions (\theta_1 \u2013 \theta_4) used in theta-bot and explains the choice of the nome q and imaginary time.  
- Deprecated any earlier draft evaluation notes in favor of the new comprehensive paper.
